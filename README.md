# TypeScript Technical Assessment

This TypeScript Node.js project tests for the capability to refactor, fix issues, understand code, use libraries and pre-defined endpoints and use basic but useful "thread"-related capabilities as well as other useful capabilities of TS (types).

We imagine you should spend around 3 hours.
 ## Things to concider 

 - Use of transactions
 - Concurrency
 - Code style + structure

## Going Above and Beyond the Requirements

Given the time expectations of this exercise, we don't expect anyone to submit anything super fancy, but if you find yourself with extra time, any extra credit item(s) that showcase your unique strengths would be awesome! ðŸ™Œ

It would be great for example if you'd write some unit test / simple frontend demostrating calls to your fresh APIs.
